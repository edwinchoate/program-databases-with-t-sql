# Notes

## Ch. 1 Create Views of the Data

Tell SQL Server which db to use:

```SQL
USE DatabaseName;
GO
```

Interact with SQL Server from the command prompt: 

```shell
C:\> sqlcmd
1>
```

The `AS` keyword can be used to alias an entire table:

```SQL
...
JOIN Application.People AS Contacts
...
```

In order to run `CREATE VIEW` queries, your user needs the following permissions:

1. Creating views 
2. Altering the schema

Creating a view:

```SQL
CREATE VIEW SchemaName.ViewName
AS
-- Query goes here
```

You can put aliased, literal values into a query on-the-fly:

```SQL
SELECT
    CustomerID,
    'Customer' AS ContactType
FROM Customers;    
```

`UNION` combines the results of multiple `SELECT` statements:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```
